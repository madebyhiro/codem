<h1>Overview</h1>
</div>

<p>
	A job in the Scheduler can be in one of a number of states. Whenever a state changes occurs, it will be saved to the database with a timestamp, 
	and can be viewed in the web front end or retrieved from the Scheduler API. The API documentation for state changes can be found <a href="http://rubydoc.info/github/madebyhiro/codem-schedule/master/Api/NotificationsController" rel="external">here</a>. State changes can also be used as a hook to send out <a href="notifications.html">notifications</a> via email or the web. By default, notifications (if any) are sent out when a job enters the
	Scheduled or Failed state. It is however relatively easy to add notification hooks to the other states as well.
</p>

<p>A job can be in one of these states:</p>

<table class="table table-bordered">
  <tr>
    <th><a href="#scheduled">Scheduled</a></th>
    <td>The job is waiting to be accepted by a Transcoder</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="#processing">Processing</a></th>
    <td>The job is being transcoded by the Transcoder</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="#on_hold">On hold</a></th>
    <td>The Transcoder instance for this job is currently unreachable</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="#success">Success</a></th>
    <td>The job has been successfully transcoded</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="#failed">Failed</a></th>
    <td>The job could not be transcoded because an error occured</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2 id="scheduled">Scheduled</h2>
<p>
	When a job enters the Scheduled state, it is waiting to be accepted by a Transcoder. Either the scheduling has not begun yet, or all Transcoder instances
	are unable to accept any more jobs. A Transcoder instance has a number of slots available, which are by default defined by the number of processors a 
	machine has.
</p>

<h2 id="processing">Processing</h2>
<p>
	The job is currently being processed by a Transcoder. A value between 0 and 1 indicating the progress of the job will be updated and is provided
	in the API and web front end.
</p>

<h2 id="on_hold">On Hold</h2>
<p>
	Whenever a Transcoder affiliated with a job is unavailable, that job will enter the On Hold state. Either the Transcoder has gone away
	or did not respond in time. Since no information is available about the job's progress, the job will enter the On Hold state. Whenever a Transcoder
	is responding again, the job will enter either the Processing or Failed state, based on what the Transcoder reports.
</p>

<h2 id="Success">Success</h2>
<p>
	When a Transcoder successfully finishes transcoding a job, this job will enter the Success state. The job's progress will be set to 1 and
	notifications (if any) will be sent by the Scheduler.
</p>

<h2 id="failed">Failed</h2>
<p>
	If an error occurs in the Transcoder, a job will enter the Failed state. A message indicating the error will be stored alongside the state change.
	Notifications (if any) will be sent by the Scheduler. Failed jobs will not automatically be rescheduled.
